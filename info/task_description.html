    You are the developer of the new strategy game and you need to add to this game the process of the soldiers creation. Let's start with 2 types - AsianArmy and EuropeanArmy (each of them will be a subclass of the Army - class with methods for soldier creation). Also in the game will be the 3 types of the soldiers - Swordsman, Lancer and Archer (also a classes). Each army has the unique names for those 3 types. For the EuropeanArmy there are: Knight (for Swordsman), Raubritter (for Lancer) and Ranger (for Archer). For the AsianArmy: Samurai (for Swordsman), Ronin (for Lancer) and Shinobi (for Archer).<br>
Each army can create all 3 types of the soldiers using tne next methods:<br>
<br>
<strong>train_swordsman</strong>(name) - create an instance of the Swordsman.<br>
<strong>train_lancer</strong>(name) - create an instance of the Lancer.<br>
<strong>train_archer</strong>(name) - create an instance of the Archer.<br>
<br>
All 3 classes (Swordsman, Lancer and Archer) shoud have the method <strong>introduce()</strong>, which returns the string which describes the soldiers in the next format:<br>
"'type' 'name', 'army type' 'specialization(basic class)'", for example:<br>
"Raubritter Harold, European lancer"<br>
"Shinobi Kirigae, Asian archer"<br>
<br>
<br>
In this mission you should use the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern'>Abstract Factory</a> design patter.

<p>
<strong>Example</strong>:
<pre class="brush: python">
my_army = EuropeanArmy()
enemy_army = AsianArmy()

soldier_1 = my_army.train_swordsman("Jaks")
soldier_2 = my_army.train_lancer("Harold")
soldier_3 = my_army.train_archer("Robin")

soldier_4 = enemy_army.train_swordsman("Kishimoto")
soldier_5 = enemy_army.train_lancer("Ayabusa")
soldier_6 = enemy_army.train_archer("Kirigae")

soldier_1.introduce() == "Knight Jaks, European swordsman"
soldier_2.introduce() == "Raubritter Harold, European lancer"
soldier_3.introduce() == "Ranger Robin, European archer"
    
soldier_4.introduce() == "Samurai Kishimoto, Asian swordsman"
soldier_5.introduce() == "Ronin Ayabusa, Asian lancer"
soldier_6.introduce() == "Shinobi Kirigae, Asian archer"
</pre>
